# 🖥️ Legacy UI Modernization – Figma Design System

This design system supports a ColdFusion-to-Ruby on Rails migration by normalizing UI elements across old and new pages. Built in **Figma** and documented with **Storybook**, it accelerates frontend development through reusable, consistent components.

## 🎯 Goals

- Normalize UI across legacy and new Rails pages
- Create reusable, documented components
- Speed up front-end handoffs using shared specs and tokens

## 👩‍💻 My Role

I designed and implemented the full front-end UI system using Figma and Storybook. My process focused on component modularity, visual consistency, and clean developer handoff—eliminating the need for traditional spec sheets.

## 🔠 Typography Spec

This system uses the Inter font family, optimized for readability and scalability. The table below defines the primary type hierarchy:

## 🛠 Developer Handoff Ready

Each component in Figma is:
- Built with Auto Layout + Variants
- Fully annotated for dev inspection
- Linked to working React counterparts via Storybook
