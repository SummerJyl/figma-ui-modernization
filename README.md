# 🖥️ Legacy UI Modernization – Figma Design System

This design system supports a ColdFusion-to-Ruby on Rails migration by normalizing UI elements across old and new pages. Built in **Figma** and documented with **Storybook**, it accelerates frontend development through reusable, consistent components.

---

## 🔧 Tools Used

- Figma  
- React  
- Storybook  
- Tailwind CSS (optional)

## 🎯 Goals

- Normalize UI across legacy and new Rails pages  
- Create reusable, documented components  
- Speed up front-end handoffs using shared specs and tokens

---

## 👩‍💻 My Role

I designed and implemented the full front-end UI system using Figma and Storybook. My process focused on component modularity, visual consistency, and clean developer handoff—eliminating the need for traditional spec sheets.

## 🔠 Typography Spec

This system uses the Inter font family, optimized for readability and scalability. The table below defines the primary type hierarchy:

**Includes:**

- Buttons (primary, ghost, icon)  
- Form fields and inputs  
- Banners and alerts  
- Cards, headers, and CTAs  
- Navigation menus and tab structures  
- Toasts, modals, and more

## 🛠 Developer Handoff Ready

Each component in Figma is:

- Built with Auto Layout + Variants  
- Fully annotated for dev inspection  
- Linked to working React counterparts via Storybook
